# 🌐 Network Access Setup Guide

## 🎯 Make Your Chat Viewer Available on Local Network

Your Chatter Viewer is now configured to be accessible from any device on your local network!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Automatic Network Setup (Recommended)
```bash
npm run start:network
```
This will:
- Display your network IP addresses
- Show connection URLs for other devices
- Start the development server with network access

### Option 2: Manual Network Start
```bash
npm run dev:network
```
Then access via your IP addresses (see below).

### Option 3: Standard Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Only accessible from this computer (localhost).

## 📱 Your Network Addresses

Based on your current network configuration:

### 🖥️ Local Access (This Computer)
- `http://localhost:5173`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

### 📱 Network Access (Other Devices)
- `http://192.168.1.71:5173` (Main WiFi network)
- `http://100.64.43.155:5173` (Secondary network)

## 🔧 How to Connect Other Devices

1. Make sure your phone is connected to the **same WiFi network**
2. Open any web browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.)
3. Type in the address bar: `192.168.1.71:5173`
4. Press Enter/Go

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

### ✅ Safe Usage
- **Local Network Only**: Only devices on your WiFi can access
- **No Internet Exposure**: Not accessible from outside your network
- **Temporary**: Server stops when you close the terminal

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- Anyone on your WiFi network can access your chats
- Make sure you trust everyone on your network
- The server runs until you press `Ctrl+C`
- Your chat data stays on your computer

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Can't connect" from other devices
**Solutions:**
1. **Check WiFi**: Ensure all devices are on the same network
2. **Check Firewall**: macOS might block connections
   ```bash
   # Allow connections (if prompted by macOS)
   # Click "Allow" when macOS asks about network access
   ```
3. **Try Different IP**: Use `100.64.43.155:5173` if the first doesn't work

### Problem: "Address already in use"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill any existing servers
pkill -f "vite"
# Then restart
npm run start:network
```

### Problem: Node.js version error
**Note:** You're using Node.js 18.18.0, but Vite 7 prefers 20+. The app works fine, but consider upgrading for optimal performance.
